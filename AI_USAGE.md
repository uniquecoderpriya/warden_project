**User Prompt:**

```
"@index.ts i m getting cors error pls setup the config"
```

**AI Response:**

```typescript
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: "http://localhost:3000",
    credentials: true,
    methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],
    allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
  })
);
```

**Verification:**

- Tested API calls from frontend
- Confirmed CORS headers in response
- No more cross-origin errors

#### Prompt 4: Runtime Error Fix

**User Prompt:**

```
"check the rerror"
```

**AI Response:**

- Added null checks for weather data
- Implemented fallback UI for missing weather
- Added optional chaining throughout components

**Verification:**

- Tested with properties having no weather data
- Confirmed graceful error handling
- No more undefined property errors

### Phase 3: UI/UX Enhancements

#### Prompt 5: Pagination Implementation

**User Prompt:**

```
"this pagination i want in my code" (followed by Ant Design code)
```

**AI Response:**

- Replaced custom pagination with Ant Design
- Implemented responsive design for mobile
- Added proper state management for pagination

**Verification:**

- Tested pagination on different screen sizes
- Confirmed proper page navigation
- Mobile responsiveness verified

#### Prompt 6: Card Design Optimization

**User Prompt:**

```
"my card images is to big reduce the size and make it optimized"
```

**AI Response:**

- Reduced image height from default to `h-32`
- Decreased padding and margins
- Changed text sizes to 10px
- Optimized spacing and gaps

**Verification:**

- Visual comparison before/after
- Confirmed smaller, more compact cards
- Maintained readability

#### Prompt 10: Image Optimization

**User Prompt:**

```
"here the image all 8 should be diffrent"
```

**AI Response:**

- Replaced propertyImages array with unique Unsplash URLs
- Ensured all 8 properties have different images
- Used reliable image sources

**Verification:**

- Visual confirmation of all unique images
- Tested image loading reliability
- No more blank/white image areas

## üîç Code Quality & Verification Process
